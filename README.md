# Sorting-algo-Visualizer
A web application that demonstrates the operational mechanics of six sorting algorithms, using colors to illustrate each step of the process.



Implemented algorithms:
1) Bubble sort
2) Selection sort
3) Insertion sort
4) Merge sort
5) Quick sort
6) Heap sort

Here are the key features of the visualization tool:

1)Color-coded steps:

->Blue for default representation
->Yellow for elements being compared
->Red for elements identified as incorrectly positioned and needing movement
->Green for elements in the correct position
2)Visualization controls:

->Adjustable speed (5 levels) and Scalable data size
->Ability to generate new random data
3)Displays time and space complexity of the algorithm in real-time.
